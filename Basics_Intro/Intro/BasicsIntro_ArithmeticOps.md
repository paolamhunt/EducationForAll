- use “\+=”, “\-=”, “\*=" and “/=” as shorthands of operations.
    - Example:
~~~
a = 2
a += 3 # it is the same as a=a+3
print(a)## 5
a = 4
a -= 3 # it is the same as a=a-3
print(a)## 1
a = 5
a *= 3 # it is the same as a=a*3
print(a)## 15
a = 6
a /= 3 # it is the same as a=a/3
print(a)## 2.0
